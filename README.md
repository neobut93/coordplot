This is a coordinated application. 
The app consists of a coordinated image layout with 2 sliders. 
Each slider represents X and Y coordinates and allows the user to move the point inside the coordinate image.
During the enhancement work, the app was refactored
Below are the changes which have been added to the app:
- 2 box layouts which represents x/y coordinates and circles have been updated. They are using use components instead of background colors.
- the theme and colors of the app were updated, so users will get a slightly different experience in light and dark modes.
- all compose functions were moved to my own Kotlin files
- sliders were updated to display the percentage value
- all strings were moved to the Resource folders
- The background of the app was updated. It's using image component now instead of background color
- A custom splash screen has been added
